<div id="introduction">
<h1>What is a Food wastage</h1>
<p>Food wastage refers to any food lost by deterioration or waste. Thus, the term “wastage” encompasses both food loss and food waste.”</p>
</div>

<div id="percent">
  <h1>How much of food is getting wasted ??</h1>
  <p>Close to one-fifth of imported and locally farmed fresh produce here is lost along the food supply chain every year, amounting to a loss of $2.54 billion
    The study found that the one-fifth of food that is lost and wasted translates to 393,000 tonnes of vegetables, fruits, fish,
   seafood and eggs that are spoilt and damaged during the post-harvest stage, storage, packaging and transportation.
  </p>
</div>


<div id="cause">
  <h1>What is the Cause of this Food wastage??</h1>
  <p>From the study, the main causes of food loss are poor disease and pest management in farms and warehouses, over-importing, a broken cold chain management, and inadequate infrastructure to prevent food spoilage.
   This is the first food waste study that examines food loss and waste from farm to market.</p>

<div id="effect">
  <h1>How will the food waste effect the farmers??</h1>
  <p>The first level of food waste is on the farm. Fifty-percent of land is used for agriculture, yet, an enormous amount of food is wasted due to a lack of storage space, labor shortages, weather, pests, and uncertain market demand. ... They also provide post-harvest farming tools, providing free training materials, as well.</p>
